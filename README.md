# FUN88

This project was developed as part of a React coding test.

## About the Project

This app was created during a coding test to demonstrate my skills in React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Redux.  
The app is a simple clone of the FUN88 app, focusing on features like game selection, filtering, and a favorites list.

## Requirements

1. Use Promises to mock APIs for retrieving the game list.
2. Allow selecting different categories (START, NEW, SLOTS, etc.).
3. Implement a search functionality to find games.
4. Include a filter to select games by Game Provider.
5. Use a Carousel for the banner (the same image can be used for simplicity).
6. Allow users to add or remove games from favorites.

> **Note:** This app is designed specifically for mobile view only with fixed width and height.
